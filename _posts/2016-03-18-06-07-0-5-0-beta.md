**API changes since 0.4.0-rc2**

 - The concept of **hook handler** now becomes **API service** after DI integration.
 - The interface `IHookHandler` and `IDelegateHookHandler` are removed. The implementation of any custom API service (previously known as hook handler) should also change accordingly. But this should not be big change. Please see [Tutorial](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#04-04-Api-Service) for details.
 - `AddHookHandler` is now replaced with `ChainPrevious` and `CutoffPrevious` from DI. Please see [Tutorial](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#04-04-Api-Service) for details.
 - `GetHookHandler` is now replaced with `GetApiService` and `GetService` from DI. Please see [Tutorial](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#04-04-Api-Service) for details.
 - All the serializers and `DefaultRestierSerializerProvider` are now public. But we still need to address [#301](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/issues/301) to allow users to override the serializers.
 - The interface `IApi` is now removed. Use `ApiBase` instead. We never expect users to directly implement their API classes from `IApi` anyway. The `Context` property in `IApi` now becomes a public property in `ApiBase`.
 - Previously the `ApiData` class is very confusing. Now we have given it a more meaningful name `DataSourceStubs` which accurately describes the usage. Along with this change, we also rename `ApiDataReference` to `DataSourceStubReference` accordingly.
 - `ApiBase.ApiConfiguration` is renamed to `ApiBase.Configuration` to keep consistent with `ApiBase.Context`.
 - The static `Api` class is now separated into two classes `ApiBaseExtensions` and `ApiContextExtensions` to eliminate the ambiguity regarding the previous `Api` class.
