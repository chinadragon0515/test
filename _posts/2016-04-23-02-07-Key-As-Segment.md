RESTier supports key as segment with one single line configuration before calling MapRestierRoute method:

{% highlight csharp %}
config.SetUrlConventions(ODataUrlConventions.ODataSimplified);
{% endhighlight %}

Then request an entity with key as segment, the URL will be like
`~/EntitySet/KeyValue`

Note : If entity type has composite key, then key as segment is not supported for this entity type.
