RESTier helps to build OData service which is RESTful services, so any REST client or http client can be used to send requests and receive responses.

OData team develops a .Net Client which can work with any OData services, refer to ["Basic CRUD Operations with OData .Net Client"](http://odata.github.io/odata.net/#04-01-basic-crud-operations) for details.

OData team also develops two client tools to facilitate OData Client application development, refer to ["Using OData Client Code Generator to generate client-side proxy class"](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/odatateam/archive/2014/03/12/how-to-use-odata-client-code-generator-to-generate-client-side-proxy-class.aspx) and ["Using OData Connected Service to generate client-side proxy class"](http://odata.github.io/odata.net/#OData-Client-Code-Generation-Tool) for details.
